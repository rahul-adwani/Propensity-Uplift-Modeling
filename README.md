# What do we need to do?

### We need to identify the customers who are Persuadables and approach them with Digital Marketing Campaigns
- This will help us in running campaign operations in a much more efficient way with a very high conversion rate
### We need to avoid all the other 3 types of customers - Sure Things, Do Not Disturb and Lost Causes
- This will help us save unnecessary costs and hence improving the Cost Per Click
